# Customer-Reviews-Analysis-and-Topic-Modeling
## web_crawler.py
* Used a combination of HTTP requests and regular expressions to scrape the review data from the Amazon website.
## EDA+NLP_model_analyze.ipynb
* Clustered customer reviews into groups and discovered the latent semantic structures using Python. 
* Preprocessed review text by tokenization, stemming, removing stop words and extracted features by Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF).
* Trained unsupervised learning models of K-means clustering and Latent Dirichlet Analysis 
* Identified latent topics and keywords of each review for clustering.
* Visualized model training results by dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
## ETL+pipeline.ipynb
* Created the ETL data pipeline in order to build the machine learning pipeline. Improved the working efficiency.
